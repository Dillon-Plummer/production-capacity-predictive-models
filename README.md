# Predicting manufacturing capacity
This is a Streamlit app and group of 3 machine learning models to predict production capacity in a regulated manufacturing setting (medical devices).  The models are fully transparent for ISO and FDA audits, based on supervised Random Forest classifiers with gradient boosters.  The model explainability ensures compliance with the ISO 13485 and ISO 14971 standards.

The cli.py file allows the model training to be accomplished directly in the command line.
